# Quizzy Library
This library allows its users to create a quiz game that will be displayed through a GUI or the terminal.</br>The library has been effectively implemented by using a variety of design patterns.

## Design Patterns
1. **Singelton** & **Data Access Object (DAO)** - implemented in *SimpleCSVQuizFilesDAO* class.
2. **Factory** & **Prototype** - implemented in *QuizFactory* class.
3. **Builder** - implemented in *QuizQuestion* class.

## Notes
* Any question in the quiz has to include 5 answers.
* There is an option to load an existing quiz or save a new one.
* At the end of the quiz, the user gets the score (each correct answer equals one point).

## Tests
* The library includes various Unit Tests developed with JUnit framework.
